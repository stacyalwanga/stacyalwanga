👋 About Me
I'm a passionate Cybersecurity Engineer with expertise in penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, incident response, and security training. Currently working at Cyber Guard Africa, I specialize in identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities across web applications, mobile apps, cloud environments, and network infrastructure.
With a strong foundation in both offensive and defensive security, I help organizations strengthen their security posture through comprehensive assessments, strategic recommendations, and hands-on training.
